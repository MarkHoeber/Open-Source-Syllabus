2012 - edX
####################

Founded by Harvard University and MIT in 2012, edX is an online learning destination and MOOC provider, offering high-quality courses from the worldâ€™s best universities and institutions to learners everywhere.

But it's more than that. The code that runs edx.org is known as Open edX and is an open source platform.  Anyone or any institution in the world can run Open edX and host their own classes, and hundreds already do.  Anyone can modify Open edX and submit changes back to edX. 

In fact, we will do just that later in the course.

************

* Making the platform open source was a strategic move by edX to accelerate development and enhance the product, to better compete with for-profit Coursera and its closed system. Open source is a key strategy to meet the goal of transforming education.

* For profit companies are emerging to customize and host Open edX for institutions.
