Class will guide you through the process of making a change to edX
documentation. EdX will provide a list of changes we can select to do.

You can choose to do something else.

Students can work in pairs.

.. note:: The goal is to understand the process of making a change, not to make
  a world-changing contribution. Choose to do something easy and
  straightforward, such as fixing a typo.
