Goals
*******

The goal of this course is to help learners become familiar with the world of
open source software.

Learners will explore the history and philosophy of the open source movement,
and some of the larger open source projects.

To provide hands-on experience, the course will culminate in learners submitting
their own changes to open source projects.

From history and philosophy, tools and technology, business and sociology, open
source software could fill a semester or year.  At only 6 hours of class time,
this course is meant to be a broad introduction. By necessity a lot of detail is
skipped.

At the end of the course, learners should have an appreciation of open source
software and the knowledge and tools to explore the open source world on their
own.

An Open Course
****************

We're not just learning about the open source world, we are experiencing it.

How? Let's look at the ways:

* Most of the content of this course comes from freely available sources, such
  as Wikipedia, YouTube, and SlideShare. My
  role is to assemble the source into a coherent story that meets our
  objectives.

* Content on |WP| and YouTube, two of our primary sources, is created by users,
  not owners. That is, these platforms derive their value from the aggregated
  efforts of the community, just as do the open source projects we will discuss.

* This syllabus is created, stored, and hosted using only open source tools.
  This didn't cost a cent, and just about any aspect of it can be modified.

* In fact, **this syllabus is open source**, with a :ref:`Creative Commons
  license <Creative Commons Licenses>`. You can, and are encouraged to, make it
  better and to share it, using the tools we will learn about.


Expectations
*************

Learners must bring curiosity.

No experience with open source software is required. Learners should be familiar
and comfortable with either a Mac or Windows, and web browsing.

Learners should do the reading and watch videos outside of class, so we can use
class time for discussion and hands on learning.
