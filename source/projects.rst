Projects
#########

Now is the time to get hands on and participate in an open source project.

Options
*********

Class will guide you through the process of making a change to edX
documentation. EdX will provide a list of changes we can select to do.

You can choose to do something else. For example, you can submit an update to this syllabus.  Need an idea? You can find an open source project that interests you and add it to the :ref:`Example Open Source Projects` page, or great a new history page for it.

Students can work in pairs.

.. note:: The goal is to understand the process of making a change, not to make
  a world-changing contribution. Choose to do something easy and
  straightforward, such as fixing a typo.
