Introduction to Open Source Software
#####################################

**Middlesex Community College Course # TEC 758-30**

This course is an introduction to Open Source software. We
will look at the history of some of the most successful open source projects.
We'll cover common tools and processes used in the open source world.
Learners will work through the process of making a contribution to an open
source project, culminating in seeing their work go live and be shared with the
world.

No software coding skills are required. To make this course accessible to all,
class contributions can be to open source documentation projects.

This course is geared for anyone looking for an introduction to open source
projects, and will especially benefit technical writers who want to expand
their skills.

.. note:: Later in the course, the class will have the option of contributing to
  Open edX. If you plan to take this option, fill out the
  |edX Contributor Agreement| now and send to edX.
