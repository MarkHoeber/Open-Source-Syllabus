|Takeaways|
************

* A benevolant dictator (BD) leads and facilitates the community. Only the BD
  merges code. The BD model is simple, but depends on the BD being neutral and
  respected.

* A meritocracy does not have leaders. Decisions are made by action.
  Contributions earn merit and merit earns authority.

* Main difference in models is how deadlocks are broken.
